These solutions belong to exercises from Tim Buchalka's
Java Programming Masterclass covering Java 11 & Java 17
course.

There could be plenty of solutions for one exercise but I chose
only one of them. So feel free to share your solutions.

Also I solved them by the process of the course. I mean,
if Tim hasn't taught Arrays, I didn't use them for the solutions.
